# Delegate

An assigned follow-up is one you have delegated to someone else.

Examples: Your colleague is on vacation, but needs to phone a client when they get back. You arranged a meeting with a client, but you need to delegate it to someone else.

**Options:**

* Assign a follow-up to someone (change owner)
* Re-assign a follow-up
* [Create an appointment in an associate's diary][2]

## Assign a follow-up

1. [Open or create a follow-up][1].

1. Select owner. Do one of the following:

    * Select the **Details** tab and click the name in the **Owner** field.
    * Click the ![icon][img1] **Task** button and select **Assign to**.

1. In The **Assign to** dialog, click the list at the top to select which users to display (history list, all or groups).

1. Select a person from the list. A conflict icon indicates if a person has another follow-up at the given time.

1. Click **OK** and **Save**.

The selected person is now the owner of the follow-up. It appears in the **Invitations** dialog in SuperOffice for the other person, and they will see the follow-up in their diary and activities list.

## Re-assign

If the other person declines the invitation, it appears as declined in your own **Invitations** dialog.

1. Click the **Reassign** button to assign the follow-up to someone else.

2. The **Assign to** dialog appears, allowing you to select another person to delegate the task to.

3. The follow-up is now displayed with the status **Assigned** in the **Invitations** dialog.
