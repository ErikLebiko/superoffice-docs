# Change Completed status of an activity

When you consider that an activity is finished, you can mark it as completed.

**Completed** is a toggle option, which you activate and deactivate using the same menu option or shortcut key. A tick specifies that the activity is **Completed**.

## Steps

Do one of the following:

* Open the activity and uncheck the **Completed** icon at the top-right of the dialog.

    ![Change Completed status of an activity -screenshot][img3]

* Hold the mouse pointer over the box in the **Completed** column ![icon][img2] in the **Activities** section tab. Then click the checkbox ![icon][img1].

* Right-click the activity and choose **Completed**.
