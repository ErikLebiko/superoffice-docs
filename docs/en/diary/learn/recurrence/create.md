# Schedule repeating follow-up

To set up recurrence means to schedule the *start date* of follow-ups in a series. If you want to change the *time*, [update a specific instance][1].

## Steps

1. [Open or create a follow-up][2].

2. Select the **Details** tab and click the word **Never** next to the **Recurrence** field.

3. Choose **frequency:** should the follow-up be repeated daily, weekly, monthly, yearly, or at a user-defined interval?

4. Select further details for the [frequency pattern][4]. The options in the box depend on what you select in step 3.

    If you select **Custom**, you can manually enter the dates you require. Select the day in the calendar and click the arrow ![icon][img2] to add it to the list of selected dates. To delete a date, select the date in the list and click **Delete**.

5. In the **Repeating follow-ups ends** field, choose if the follow-up should stop after a specific number of times or after a specific date.

6. Optionally, change one or more dates manually in the list of selected dates, for example, if there is a conflict.

    * **To move a date**, select the date you want to move, and click **Later** ![icon][img3] to defer the follow-up by one day, or **Earlier** ![icon][img4] to bring the follow-up one day forwards.

    * **To add a date**, click the **Add** button below the list. Select the required date and click the arrow button ![icon][img2] to the right of the calendar to add the date to the list. Use the arrow buttons ![icon][img5] ![icon][img2] on either side of the month name in the calendar to display other months.

    * **To delete a date**, select the date you want to delete, and click the **Delete** button below the list. The date will then be removed from the list of dates.

7. Click **OK** to save the dates and close the dialog, or click **Cancel** to close the dialog without saving the dates.

8. Click **Save** in the **Follow-up** dialog to save all changes.

In the dialog, the text next to the **Recurrence** field will show what sort of repetition you specified for the follow-up, for example, **Monthly (23.09.2023 - 23.09.2024)**.
