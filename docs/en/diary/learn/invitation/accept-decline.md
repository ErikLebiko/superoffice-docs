# Follow-ups you are invited to

When you view a follow-up you are not the owner of, the usual **Appointment**, **Task**, or **Phone Call** dialog is displayed. However, you cannot make changes to other people's invitations, nor add participants, so the **Add** button in the **Participants** tab is disabled.

* Until you accept or decline the invitation, the dialog has two extra buttons: **Accept** and **Decline**. After you accept, the button is disabled.

* Because you did not create the appointment, task or phone call yourself, you may change only the **Priority**, **Alarm**, and **Completed** fields. All other options are disabled.

Participants who are invited to a follow-up will receive a notification on the Top bar. Click the **Notifications** icon to view the invitations(s).

![Receive invitations -screenshot][img2]

* At the top is a list of your invitations, with status and icons.

* Below is more detailed information about the invitations you selected in the top section. This includes a full description of the invitation, the date and other complementary details.

## Icons for follow-ups

The icons in the list of invitations show information about the follow-up you are invited to:

| Icon | Description |
|---|---|
| ![icon][img3] | Icon for follow-ups you accepted an invitation to. |
| ![icon][img4] | Icon for follow-ups you declined. These follow-ups stay in the **Invitations** dialog until the day after the follow-up takes place, so that you retain the option of changing your mind. |
| ![icon][img5] | Repeating follow-up. |

## Filter the display

To get a better overview of your invitations, you can filter the view using three checkboxes:

* Check **Show responses** to display rejection messages from others you invited.
* Check **Show declined** to display follow-ups you yourself declined.
* Check **Show repetitions** to show repeating follow-ups. If the invitation concerns a repeating follow-up, all instances of the follow-up are shown in the **Invitations** dialog. You can then either accept or decline them individually.

> [!TIP]
> It is often a good idea to check **Show repetitions** so you can decide if you are able to attend each individual meeting. To accept all at the same time, uncheck **Show repetitions** again, select the row with the relevant follow-up and select **Accept**.

Check all three to show all this information at the same time.

If you do not check any of these options, all that is displayed are follow-ups you are invited to but have not yet made a decision on.

## <a id="accept" />Accept or decline invitation

When you select one of the invitations in the top part of the dialog, its details are displayed below. The active follow-up is highlighted. Accept or decline the invitation by clicking **Accept** or **Decline**:

| Action | Description |
|---|---|
| Accept | Says yes to the invitation. A green tick is displayed to the left of your name in the list of participants in the bottom pane. The follow-up is moved from the **Invitations** dialog to your diary. |
| Decline | Says no to the selected invitation. A red cross is displayed to the left of your name in the list of participants in the bottom pane. The follow-up is removed from the **Invitations** dialog. The **Reason for declining** dialog opens, where you can enter why you are declining the invitation. |

> [!TIP]
> When you select an invitation in the **Invitations** dialog, the day in question is shown in the Diary screen in the background, so that you can check if you have other appointments.
If you have other overlapping appointments, a **Conflict** icon ![icon][img6] is also displayed in the preview in the **Invitations** dialog.

## Invitation to repeating follow-up

If you select **Show repetitions** below the list of invitations, all instances of the follow-up are displayed.

There are two ways to see if a [follow-up is recurring][3]:

* The status icon ![icon][img5] is shown in the list of invitations.
* You will see a 'repeat' icon at the upper left of the bottom section of the dialog.

Click **Close** to close the dialog.

### Note

* If you first accept an invitation and then delete the follow-up from the diary, it is counted as though you declined it. The follow-up disappears from the Diary and your name is marked with a red cross ![icon][img4] in the **Appointment**, **Task** or **Phone Call** dialog of the person who sent the invitation.

* If you accept an invitation and subsequently open the dialog for follow-ups, you cannot edit any information about the follow-up except for the **Priority**, **Completed** and **Alarm** fields. Other changes can be made only by the person who sent the invitation.

* If you assign a follow-up to another user (change owner), and the recipient declines it, this works as when you [handle responses to invitations][4].

* If you close the **Invitations** dialog without accepting or declining the invitation, the follow-up remains there and an eye icon ![icon][img7] is displayed next to your name in the **Appointment**, **Task** or **Phone Call** dialog to show that you have seen it, but not made a decision.

* Invitations are saved up until the day after the follow-up is marked as completed so that the participants can be informed of changes.
