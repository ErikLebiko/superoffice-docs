# Invite your associates to a follow-up

Invitations are **created** when calling meetings or other arrangements between different members of a company. You invite several associates or resources to join. When an invitation is **accepted** it will be displayed on the user’s diary.

To allocate time for a meeting with one or more associates, use the **View** tab in the Diary screen. Here you can open your associates' diaries to see when your colleagues are available for a meeting. In addition, you can select to view resources such as conference rooms, to see when they are free and set up a joint reservation for everyone from within your own diary.

Follow-ups with associates are set up by linking them as participants to the follow-up.

When we save the meeting, an invitation will be added to the person we invited and will be shown in the diary of the person on the appropriate date and time. **This only happens if the invited person also is an associate.** You may invite persons belonging to other contacts as well, these will not have a diary where the meeting is shown, but it will be shown in the activity archive of their contact instead.

> [!NOTE]
> Resources and non-user persons don't receive invitations – the meeting is just created as a normal meeting for them.

## <a id="status" />Status

The users you chose to link to a follow-up will be notified of this on their screens. If you open the follow-up's **Participants** tab, you will see a list of participants and resources linked to the follow-up. You can also see who accepted or declined the invitation and which resources have been booked, from the symbols next to the names:

| Icon | Description |
|:-:|---|
| ![icon][img1] | Invitation is accepted. |
| ![icon][img2] | Invitation is declined. |
| ![icon][img3] | Invitation is seen but not answered. |
| unmarked | Invitation has not been seen. |

## Resources

When you link resources, the status is set to *accepted* because a resource cannot answer the invitation itself.

It is possible to double-book a resource. If a resource is not free at the time, **Conflict** is shown in the **Status** column. An exclamation mark is also displayed in the **Follow-up** dialog. You should change the time of the follow-up. The **First available** field displays the first available meeting time.

## External contacts

The people you choose under **Company** in the **Invitation** dialog are not usually members of your organization. You can send the invitation to them via email using the **Email invitation** option. Invitation emails sent to external contacts will contain an iCal file (.ics) with the invitation data. When they respond to your invitation, the status will automatically be updated in SuperOffice.

The follow-up is shown on the **Activities** section tab for the company.

## Handle responses to invitations

When you send an invitation, the recipient can either accept or decline it.

* If the recipient declines the invitation, you get an **Invitation declined** notification. Click **Got it** to acknowledge. Optionally, find a new suitable time and reschedule the follow-up or re-assign the follow-up to someone else.

* If the person accepts the invitation, it is recorded in SuperOffice in the usual way.
