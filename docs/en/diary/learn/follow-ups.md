# Follow-ups

*Follow-up* is a collective term for [appointment](#apt), [task](#task), and [phone call](#call). These activities all function in largely the same way.

Follow-ups may overlap each other. Overlapping follow-ups are displayed in the Diary screen so that you can see part of each follow-up.

## <a id="apt" />Appointment

Appointments are activities with a defined start and end time, such as meetings. It will be shown in the calendar of the owner's diary.

No matter where you are in SuperOffice CRM, you can create a new appointment by clicking the **New** button in the Top bar and selecting ![icon][img1].

Appointments can be displayed in the following places in SuperOffice CRM:

* The **Activities** section tab in the Company, Contact, Sale, Project, and Diary screen
* On the **Day**, **Week**, **Month**, and **View** tabs in the Diary screen
* In these side panel views: **Day**, **Month**, **Next day**, and **Week**

### Common scenarios

| Scenario | Resource | 2+ participants | Description |
|---|:-:|:-:|---|
| Own time reserved | | | You have set aside time to work on something, alone |
| Own time and resource reserved | x | | As above + need room or equipment |
| Meeting w/ multiple participants | x | x | A meeting, commonly also w/ a resource or location |

**Also:**

* Appointments can be single events or part of a recurring series.
* Overdue and completed appointments will be in the todo list in addition to in the calendar.
* Appointments involving a resource and/or additional participants are called [invitations][5] (or group reservation).
* Appointments can be created by the owner or assigned/delegated to an associate.

### Default duration

The default duration for an appointment is 1 hour, but you can change the duration as required.

1. Select **Preferences** on the **Personal settings** menu.
1. Select **Default values**.
1. [Enter the required value][1] under **Duration for new appointment**.

## <a id="task" />Task (to-do list) ![icon][img2]

A *task* is a follow-up without a start time. It usually does not have a duration either, but it always has a **deadline**.
Tasks are typically used for things you have to remember to do by a certain time.

No matter where you are in SuperOffice CRM, you can create a new task by clicking **New** > **Task** on the top bar.

By default, you will find tasks in the diary todo list, where they can be checked off when completed.

Tasks can be displayed in the following places in SuperOffice CRM:

* The **Activities** section tab in the Company, Contact, Sale, Project, and Diary screen

> [!NOTE]
> If you specify a start and end time for a task, it is entered in the diary at the correct day and time.

## <a id="call" />Phone call ![icon][img3]

A *call* is a follow-up representing a very specific action - the phone call. For example, you want to enter an outgoing phone call.

It is also kinda a hybrid between an appointment and a task:

* When you initially plan a call, it lives in the todo list with a deadline much like a task.
* When you make the call, it gets fixed in time and now resembles an appointment.
  * The start time becomes the current time and today's date.
  * The default duration is 15 minutes.

> [!TIP]
> You can change the default duration to something other than 15 minutes. Select ![icon][img4] **Personal settings** > **Preferences** > **Default values** > **Duration of a new phone call** and [enter the required value][1].

No matter where you are in SuperOffice CRM, you can create a new phone call by selecting **New** > **Phone Call** on the top bar.

Phone calls can be displayed in the following places in SuperOffice CRM:

* The **Activities** section tab in the Company, Contact, Sale, Project, and Diary screen
* On the **Day**, **Week**, **Month**, and **View** tabs in the Diary screen
* In these side panel views: **Day**, **Month**, **Next day** and **Week**.
