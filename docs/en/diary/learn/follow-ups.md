# Follow-ups

*Follow-up* is a collective term for [appointment](#apt), [task](#task), and [phone call](#call). These activities all function in largely the same way.

Follow-ups may overlap each other. Overlapping follow-ups are displayed in the Diary screen so that you can see part of each follow-up.

## <a id="apt" />Appointment

Appointments are activities with a defined start and end time, such as meetings. No matter where you are in SuperOffice CRM, you can create a new appointment by clicking the **New** button in the Top bar and selecting ![icon][img1].

### Default duration

The default duration for an appointment is 1 hour, but you can change the duration as required.

1. Select **Preferences** on the **Personal settings** menu.
1. Select **Default values**.
1. [Enter the required value][1] under **Duration for new appointment**.

## <a id="call" />Phone call

Calls are follow-ups with a default duration of 15 minutes. The default start time is the current time and the date is today's date. You can set up a call follow-up if, for example, you want to enter an outgoing phone call.
