# Add follow-up

Creating follow-ups and scheduling all meetings and activities in your SuperOffice Diary help you to always have a complete overview of what is happening, build up solid communication history, and keep your colleagues informed.

## Steps

There are many ways to create a follow-up. This method works from anywhere in SuperOffice CRM and for all types of follow-ups.

1. Click **+New** in the top bar and select **Meeting**, **To-do**, or **Follow-up**.

2. [Enter the required information in the fields.][6]

    > [!NOTE]
    > If the new follow-up overlaps with an existing follow-up, an exclamation mark ![icon][img2] is shown next to the start and stop fields as a reminder (you can still add the follow-up). A suggestion for the first vacant time slot is shown. Click the proposed time to the right of **First available** to select this time instead.
    >
    > When you create a new task, no time is displayed in the **Start** and **Due** fields. Today's date is inserted automatically, but you can change it to the required date. The date indicates the deadline for the task.

3. Click the **Save** button.

**Other options:**

| Starting point | Meeting | Follow-up (call) | To-do |
|---|---|---|---|
| Activities section tab | x | x | x |
| Task button on a contact | x | x | |
| Diary | x | | |

## Create follow-up from Activities section tab

* Click the **Add** button in the **Activities** section tab.

* Or, double-click an empty row below the last activity in the list. If you see no empty rows, position the mouse pointer between the section tabs and the card above. The pointer changes to a double-headed arrow. Then click and drag the line up to expand the section tab area.

> [!NOTE]
> If you specify a time or duration for a follow-up you are creating from within the activities list, it is entered in the Diary.

## Create follow-up from Task button

1. Click the ![icon][img3] **Task** button in the Contact card.

1. To create a meeting, select **Request a meeting**.

    To register a call, select **Make a phone call**.

1. Enter information and click **Save**.

## Create meeting from Diary

* **To choose a time slot:** click the time at which you want the meeting to start and hold the mouse button down while you drag the mouse to the required end time for the task. A blue area is displayed while you define the time slot before the **Follow-up** dialog opens.

* **To use default duration:** double-click a time in the Diary or right-click a time in the Diary and select **New**.

> [!NOTE]
> If you create the meeting from the **View** tab, you can choose to have the **Participants** dialog automatically filled out with the members of the view. To set this option, go to ![icon][img1] **Personal settings** > **Preferences** > **Functions** and set the **Participants from group view** preference to **Yes**. Click **Save**.

1. Select the **View** tab in the Diary screen.

2. Click the diary owner list and select the person's diary.

3. Create a new meeting in this diary using the mouse.

4. In the **Follow-up** dialog, [enter the required information][6].

5. [Choose the participants to include][5], if they are not automatically included.

6. Click **Save**. The meeting will be displayed in the selected person's diary.

## <a id="copy" />Copy a follow-up to the Diary

You can also create a new follow-up by copying an existing follow-up to another time or day in the diary.

1. Open the diary and locate the follow-up you wish to copy.

2. If the follow-up is completed, right-click it and choose **Completed** to enable editing. (Remember to re-set the status after copying it.)

3. Hold down the **CTRL** key while you drag and drop the follow-up to a different time.
