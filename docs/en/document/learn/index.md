# Work with documents

Storing all documents in one place helps you and your team to access up-to-date information and stay in control of customer relations.

No matter where you are in SuperOffice CRM, you can create or upload a new document by clicking **New** on the top bar and selecting **Document**. You can also create and upload new documents from the **New** button in the Top bar.

Documents can be letters, quotations or memos, and they can be displayed in several places in SuperOffice CRM.

| Screen | Section tab | Contents |
|---|---|---|
| Company | Activities | All documents linked to the active company |
| Contact | Activities | All documents linked to the active contact |
| Sale | Activities | All documents linked to the active sale |
| Project | Activities | All documents linked to the active project |
| Diary | Activities | All uncompleted documents plus those marked as completed after you last logged in to SuperOffice CRM. |
| Selection | Documents | A selection of documents |

> [!TIP]
> To open and examine an existing document, double-click the required row on the section tab.

## Standardize your documents

When working with customers, there are often documents that you create and send out repeatedly. Usually they contain the same basic elements, but different content. By creating your own [templates][11], you can be certain that the documents your employees create all look the same.

You can add any type of document template to SuperOffice CRM, whether it is a contract, a quotation, a project description, or your own version of the Privacy confirmation email.

Creating templates for frequently used documents and making them available for everyone will save your CRM users' time and ensure the unified look across your organization.

In SuperOffice CRM, you can easily create document templates for Word, Email, Excel, PowerPoint and other file types.
