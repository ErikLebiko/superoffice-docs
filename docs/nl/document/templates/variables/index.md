# Template variable reference

A personalized message is always received better than a generic message. That’s why one of the greatest benefits of using a CRM solution is the possibility to easily personalize your content and communication.

On this page, we’d like to share all the SuperOffice template variables available to you. You can also find them from Help (click F1) inside your SuperOffice CRM solution.

> [!NOTE]
> When new releases are deployed, there may be instances where the user guide does not yet include the latest template variables.

If you encounter a problem with templates check [Document templates troubleshooting][2].
