# Create a template document

To make sure everyone in your company uses the same documents, you can create and add your own document templates for different file types. Use the template variables available to personalize and automate the input of customer information to your documents.

You create a template as a document in an application which is linked to SuperOffice CRM, for example, a word-processing program. If you create the template in Word, you must save it as a normal document (with the file type **DOC** or **DOCX**), and not as a template (with the file type **DOT** or **DOTX**).

You can also create templates in HTML format, and use the SuperOffice HTML editor to edit the template.

> [!TIP]
> To add new templates, you can easily copy an existing document template file and edit this to fit your needs.

## Steps

1. Start the required application.
2. Create a new document.
3. Insert the [template variables][1] you want to use in the template, for example, variables for name, address and telephone number.
4. Save the template document somewhere where you can find it easily again.

After you define a template and save it in the template folder, an administrator must [link the template to SuperOffice CRM][2] to create documents from it.
